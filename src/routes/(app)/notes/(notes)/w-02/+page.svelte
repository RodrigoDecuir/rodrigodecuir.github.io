School, Life <br>
Reflection on school and life lately <br>

Rodrigo Decuir âœ– May 05, 2024 <br> <br>

- school teaches you what you 'need' to learn and for some people
(me) that is usually boring, I don't get how there's people that 
feel excited about solving differential equations

- for the reason above, most of the classes are monotonous, meaning
that theres a curriculum and you follow it in some logical order

- I've found that I feel happy and enjoy myself the most when I'm
learning things that I find interesting (not at school)

- I actually like cs

- some stress i've learned that is actually good

- when stressed and on due date don't bother on 
  making something different, chill

- some stress that i kind of dislike, 
  school stress doesn't treat me well, 
  I seem sad when only caring about schoolwork,
  homework, ... (school actually)

- try writing a programming language

- we learn not the most but everything from our mistakes

- the more mistakes you make the more you comprehend

- try writing a book

- not telling your goals until you've accomplished them

- school requires discipline  

- you don't need to spend all your time at school

- prioritize problem solving

- stop thinking about grades

- linux is pretty damn fcking cool

- some cool websites 

- i've learn a bit about the power of the internet,
  and why probably everyone should learn to use linux,
  make their own website...

-  

So what's the right way? <br> <br>
