On taking portraits <br>
Some reflections on taking portraits <br>
Rodrigo Decuir âœ– February 27, 2024 <br> <br>

Although i have a technical degree in photography, i never really
learned how to take a portrait(i wasn't taught to and i didn't 
knew what was the right way), i did took a lot of portraits 
but none of them was shot worrying about something that wasn't
the composition or the lighting or the moment. <br> <br>

Well maybe 'the moment' does count as a neat portrait, because it 
attains to capture someone when they are fully being themselves. <br> <br>

However there's a way i was taking portraits that i no longer 
feel should be considered as taking a neat portrait, and that
is taking a picture without engaging with your subject. <br> <br>

So what's the right way? <br> <br>

To be concise, taking portraits should be done as Julia Roberts 
when interpreting Anna in

>. <br> <br>

The difference between Julia Roberts and me is that i was mostly
taking pictures other than engaging whith the subject, and the
subject should always be treated with priority. The technical 
aspect should not be let aside, but mastered, so that you don't 
need to even think of the settings. This way you can focus on the
expressiveness of your subjects faces, their stories and how 
they seem to be feeling at the moment in time.
